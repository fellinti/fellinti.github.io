        <p>Duo Security
For this assignment I interviewed my friend Robbie Small who works as a software engineer at the company Duo Security based in Ann Arbor, Michigan. Duo Security is a company that provides two factor authentication for over 5000 organizations including Facebook, Twitter,  Yelp, and Etsy.</p>

<p>Web and Database Servers
Multiple Amazon Web Services (AWS) instances for database and web application deployment
Redis for Key/value storage (I don’t know much about this)
Web server - Google app engine for static website</p>

<p>Special Software
Salesforce for metrics
Phabricator/confluence for internal use (picking up tasks to work on/internal documentation)
Twilio API for sending out SMS messages and phone calls
Google Cloud Messaging for Push service on Android and Apple Push Notifications for iOS</p>

<p>Open Source Software/Hardware
RX java (<a href="https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava">https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava</a>) for functional programming in the android app
Hardware (Not open source) - yubikey for hardware 2 factor
Have our own open sourse APIs for most languages/platforms (<a href="https://github.com/duosecurity">https://github.com/duosecurity</a>)</p>

<p>Deployment Strategies 
Release in 2 week “sprints” for the main product
Multiple AWS instances incase one goes down/is overloaded
Google app engine for static content (duosecurity.com)</p>

<p>Security
Heavily reliant on two factor services.
Cannot authenticate without a second factor.
push notification, HOTP (HMAC-based one time passcodes), TOTP (Time-based one time passcodes) or phone callback to verify identity
Must sign into the Juniper VPN for development.
Lots of audit scripts code must pass before building the product</p>
